# Dynamic-Timetable
A prototype timetable created for a community center, it loads data from a xml file and dynamicly displays events in timetable format.

# What I learned
* DOM manipulation
* Javascript practice

# How I could improve
* I would seperate the javascript from the html file
* Whiles I used XML for prototype and the simplicity of the community center, I would consider a altenative means of storing the data such as a database
